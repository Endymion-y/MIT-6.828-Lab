1. How does cpunum() work?
2. Why should we map page from parent to child first and then map page back?
A process writes to the stack each time it calls a function with parameters. If the stack page of parent is mapped as PTE_COW first, the page will be copied and mapped as PTE_W right before mapping the child's stack page.
3. Why mark COW again if already COW?
The page may be written and become writable before mapping it in the child's space.
4. How is the disk image made?
